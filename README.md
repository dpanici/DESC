# DESC
Stellarator Equilibrium Solver

This is the primary version of the DESC code in Python.

## Contents

### Python files

DESC.py is the main script which computes and plots equilibrium solutions.
The following files contain supplemental functions: 
- backend.py - set of core functions and jax/numpy compatibility layer
- boundary_conditions.py - functions for calculating boundary errors
- continuation.py - calls the optimization routine and functions for perturbing solutions
- field_components.py - functions for calculating B and J components
- gfile_helpers.py - functions for reading/writing gfiles for tokamak GS equilibria
- init_guess.py - functions for generating initial guesses for the solution
- input_output.py - functions for reading/writing input/output
- nodes.py - functions for generating collocation nodes
- objective_funs.py - assembles the objective functions to be minimized
- plotting.py - functions for plotting solutions and their errors
- zernike.py - Zernike/Fourier transforms and basis functions

### Benchmarks

Sample VMEC input files and their corresponding wout files are contained in [benchmarks/VMEC](https://github.com/ddudt/DESC/tree/python/benchmarks/VMEC).
The equivalent DESC input files are contained in [benchmarks/DESC](https://github.com/ddudt/DESC/tree/python/benchmarks/DESC).

### Documentation

Additional documentation on specific parts of the code can be found in [documentation](https://github.com/ddudt/DESC/tree/python/documentation).

## TODO List

### Priorities
- documentation
    - set up readthedocs
    - API autodoc w/ sphinx
    - docs for input/output format
    - example scripts for common operations
- automated testing/benchmarks
    - set up travis/jenkins
    - manually compare to VMEC to find good test cases
    - small unit tests for individual sections
    - larger scale regression tests running whole code for low res solution
- fringe vs ansi indexing option
- continuation method
    - more testing to make sure it gives good results
    - checkpointing
    - find good default solver parameters
- memory management for gpu
- what needs jit, which devices
- precompute SVD for fitting
- stability calculation
    - project back to get `R_tt`,`Z_tt`
    - incompressibility constraint
- symmetry, symmetric nodes, best way to enforce and reduce size
    - masking?
    - seperate transforms for R,Z?
- avoiding recompilation
    - might not really need to if compilation time can be reduced
    - masking?
    - comparing masked arrays for bdry
- profiling to find speed bottlenecks
    - evaluate bdry error in (v,z) coordinates?
    - precomputing bc interpolation stuff
    - or at least properly vectorize it so jax doesnt unroll the loops
- Don't compute all field components if not necessary

### Known Issues

- in `vmec_to_desc_input` function:
    - cannot handle multi-line VMEC inputs
    - need to remove `pres_scale` from DESC input file
- `bdry_ratio` does not work with `compute_bc_err_RZ` function

### Features to Add

- figure out asymptotics for contravariant basis at axis
- zernike transform using FFT
- QS function specifying M/N
- allow option for square system
- use `root` algorithms instead of `least_squares` (and compare results)
- autodiff hessian
- add node option to avoid rational surfaces
- I/O compatibiltiy with VMEC, GS solvers
- command line interface
- documentation
- clean up backend implementation
